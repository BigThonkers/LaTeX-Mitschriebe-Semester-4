# Scripts from the lectures B.Sc. in Physics SoSe 2019 4th Semester

This repository contains inofficial notes to the following Lectures:

"Theoretical Physics III", "Experimental Physics IV", "Higher Mathematics", and "Experimental Methods".

## Built With

* [TexStudio](https://www.texstudio.org/) and [Texpad](https://www.texpad.com/) - The IDEs used to edit LaTeX

#### Note:

All the graphics and illustrations were made within LaTeX using the Tikz package.

## Latest Version

New versions of the script will be available as soon as we have had the time to TeX the lectures. This might take up to a few days after the lecture. The date of the last commit can be seen in the commit message.

Please note that there is no guarantee as to the correctness and completeness of the notes.
